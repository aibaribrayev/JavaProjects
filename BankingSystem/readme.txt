The project involves developing a banking system with five classes: Bank, ATM, Customer, Account, and Tester.
The system allows customers to open accounts and perform transactions, while the Bank manages Accounts and ATMs.
The project also focuses on access control levels to prevent unauthorized access and the separation of bank-related and non-bank-related classes in different packages.
